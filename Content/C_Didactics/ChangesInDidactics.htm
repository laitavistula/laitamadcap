This expansion coincided with the graduation of the first generation of AVT trainers, whose doctoral theses were completed and defended during the 1990s. Additionally, associationslike  <span class="Bold"><a href="https://esist.org/">ESIST</a></span> founded in 1995, were established to facilitate information exchange and promote professional standards in screen translation training and practice.</p>
