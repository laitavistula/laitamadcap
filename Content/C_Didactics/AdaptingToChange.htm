        <h1>Industry and change</h1>
        <p>Being inherently agile and versatile, the AVT industry has continually adapted to changes in consumption patterns and professional practices since the early 2000s. The production and distribution of multimedia content have grown exponentially, with contemporary audiences increasingly opting for on-demand online videos on streaming platforms rather than traditional outlets like TV stations. This surge in production has spurred a significant increase in translation activity, primarily driven by <span class="Bold">over-the-top (OTT)</span> platforms such as:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Netflix</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Amazon</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prime Video</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>HBO Max</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Apple TV+</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Disney Plus</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These platforms sell their titles to numerous new markets. For instance, in 2019, 106.1 million (63%) of Netflix's 167.1 million subscribers were based outside of the US, highlighting how AVT and media localisation services act as key catalysts for growth in the entertainment industry.</p>
