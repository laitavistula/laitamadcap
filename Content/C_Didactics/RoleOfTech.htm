        <h1>The role of technology in training audiovisual translators</h1>
        <p>AVT, particularly subtitling, has always been closely tied to technological advancements. Key milestones include the invention of cinema in the early 20th century, the introduction of sound in the 1920s, the development of the first dedicated subtitling systems in the 1970s, and the digitalisation of images in the 1990s. In recent years, the field has experienced significant growth, driven by the exploration of cloud and language technologies that enhance productivity and streamline workflows. In the 21st century, technology’s widespread reach has accelerated the flow of cultural content, primarily in audiovisual formats.</p>
        <p> In the words of Díaz-Cintas and Massidda:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The easy availability of technology, the seduction of multimodal productions and the affordances of AVT have all acted as triggers in the rapid spread of audiovisual materials through television, computers, tablets, smart phones and silver screens. Technology has come to be an omnipresent reality that infiltrates not only the social life of the individual but also the way in which the external environment is being moulded."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As far as the AVT industry is concerned, this epochal shift is reflected in the creation of specific tools to navigate the digital era: </p>

                <p><span class="Bold">neural machine translation (NMT) engines</span>, </p>

            <li>
                <p><span class="Bold">text-to-speech (TTS)</span>, </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Bold">speech-to-text (STT)</span>, </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Bold">speech-to-speech (STS)</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> technologies are making inroads into the field. Although these systems may assist and speed up the work of professionals, they can also be perceived by some as a threat.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT), based on deep learning and neural networks, has been explored in relation to interlingual subtitling. Key findings from studies in this area highlight the importance of the raw output quality, the role of post-editing, and the potential productivity gains for subtitlers using MT compared to traditional human translation. Despite the growing industry interest in the potential of MT (Bywood, Georgakopoulou, and Etchegoyhen, 2017) and the increasing presence of post-editing in subtitling workflows, few universities worldwide have taken on the challenge of incorporating post-editing training within AVT programs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As for the incorporation of TMs into interlingual subtitling, various developers, such as memoQ and SDL, have integrated a video plugin in their translation tools in an attempt to boost the localisation of video material by dint of subtitle templates.</p>

        </p>
        <p>ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems have become essential in the AVT industry, with intralingual and interlingual respeakers using them to dictate text for live subtitles. This practice has been adopted by some universities that offer specialized courses in these fields. STT (Speech-to-Text) technology is also used to transcribe dialogue from pre-recorded audiovisual material, enabling faster workflows for creating timecoded templates. Additionally, TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology is employed by companies such as Netflix to generate synthesized voices for audio description (AD).</p>
        <p>It is undeniable that cloud computing has become the defining technology of the new millennium. Cloud-based ecosystems and platforms have not only transformed the subtitling and dubbing industry but are also starting to make an impact on education, with platforms like <a href="https://www.ooona.net/ooona-edu">OOONA Edu</a>  specifically designed for training in subtitling and SDH. While the majority of web-based platforms were initially developed with subtitling in mind, revoicing is also carving out its space in the cloud. This is due to significant advancements in speech technologies, with initiatives led by companies such as <a href="http://voiceq.com/">VoiceQ</a> and <a href="http://zoodigital.com/">ZOO Dubs</a>.</p>
        <p>While the rapid technological advancements in the field of AVT present exciting opportunities, they also pose challenges. The pace of development can be overwhelming for some stakeholders, especially smaller LSPs and freelance translators who may struggle to keep up with the changes. These professionals may be accustomed to traditional workflows or lack the financial resources to invest in new systems. Similarly, educational institutions face barriers, primarily due to the high cost of proprietary software, even though some companies offer educational packages. A lack of awareness among trainers about current professional demands and technological advancements may also contribute to the issue. As a result, access to cutting-edge technology in translation education is often limited to institutions with substantial budgets.</p>
        <p>To ensure the future success of AVT, it is crucial that new technological advancements are integrated with AVT teaching content, ensuring that study programs remain relevant and aligned with the evolving needs of the industry. The direct impact of this integration on translator training is evident, as strengthening trainees' technical skills is a key factor in enhancing their employability.</p>
