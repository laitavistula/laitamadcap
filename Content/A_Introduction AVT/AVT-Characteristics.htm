        <h1>Basic Characteristics of AVT</h1>
        <h2>Characteristics of audiovisual translation
</h2>
        <p>Audiovisual translation (AVT) has several defining characteristics that set it apart from other types of translation. Here are six key features:<![CDATA[

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span>Speech</span>.</p>
                <p>Speech forms the backbone of audiovisual content, but it’s more than just words. The tone, emotion, and nuance of dialogue work together to create an immersive experience. For example, Korean has complex <span class="Bold">honorifics</span> that can pose challenges in translation, as their subtle meanings may be lost when converted to English.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Changing source materials</span>.</p>
                <p>AVT involves translating a variety of genres, such as horror movies, children’s shows, or advertisements—each with its own language, style, and conventions. Translators must adapt to different audiences, maintain the appropriate tone and mood, handle cultural references, and adhere to specific regulations and guidelines for each type of material.<![CDATA[

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Multimodal nature</span>.</p>
                <p>Audiovisual texts are multimodal as they combine several semiotic modes like images, sound effects, music, speech, writing etc. So the translator has to consider all these modes during the translation process.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Multilingual elements</span>.</p>
                <p>AVT often requires translating a range of source language elements, such as dialogues, on-screen text, songs, and even background noises or ambient sounds, to maintain the integrity of the original content.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Synchronization</span>.</p>
                <p>Translated text in AVT must align with the timing and spatial constraints of the original video. For example, subtitles need to appear and disappear in sync with the audio, ensuring a smooth and natural viewer experience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span>Adaptation</span>.</p>
                <p>AVT often involves significant adaptation to make content relatable and entertaining for a new cultural audience. Translators may need to modify cultural references, humor, and other context-specific elements to resonate with the target audience.<![CDATA[
