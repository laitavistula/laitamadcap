        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>The beginnings of audiovisual translation</h2>
        <p>The origins of audiovisual translation (AVT) can be traced back to the era of silent cinema. At that time, cinema, as a new form of storytelling, was not always fully understood by audiences. Many viewers struggled to follow the plot and action of the films. To address this, the idea emerged of employing live actors to read or perform the dialogue for the scenes on screen. These actors, known as "interpreters," are now considered the first audiovisual translators.</p>
        <p>However, this approach did not resolve a later issue: the translation of foreign-language films. To solve this, foreign actors, playwrights, and winners of photogenic contests were brought to Hollywood to shoot parallel versions of English-language films. These low-budget versions were filmed at night, often directed by secondary American directors who did not speak the foreign language.</p>
        <p> The Spanish-language crews included people like Luis Buñuel, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Xavier Cugat, and Edgar Neville.</p>
        <p>Despite their efforts, these productions were largely unsuccessful in their intended markets for several reasons:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>The lower budgets were apparent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The original movies were often second-rate since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for example in the Spanish case) was confusing to audiences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the advent of sound cinema in the United States, the first attempts to translate films into other languages began. However, the high cost of producing films in multiple languages led studios to focus on recording English-language films. American studios then started creating subtitles in languages such as German, Spanish, and French, gradually expanding to include others. Unfortunately, subtitles were not effective for the broader audience, many of whom were illiterate. This challenge prompted the creation of the first dubbed film in 1929, titled <span class="Bold">“Rio Rita”</span>. Since then, audiovisual translations have undergone a number of changes and improvements.</p>
