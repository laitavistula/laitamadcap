        <h1>Advantages of audiovisual translation</h1>
        <p>Audiovisual translation <span class="Bold">(AVT)</span> offers significant benefits for businesses and creators. Here are some of its key advantages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Accessibility for wider audiences</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>AVT bridges language barriers, making content global. People who speak different languages can access and enjoy your audiovisual content. For instance, Netflix experienced a surge in international viewership for non-English shows like Money Heist and Dark due to effective AVT.</p>
        <p>Importantly, AVT also enhances accessibility for people with hearing impairments, enabling them to engage with diverse media—from films and TV shows to online videos and video games.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>
                <p>Cultural exchange and understanding</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>AVT fosters cultural understanding by introducing audiences to the customs, traditions, and societal issues of other cultures. Through translated movies, series, or documentaries, viewers gain valuable insights, promoting global tolerance, appreciation, and connection.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>
                <p>Support for language learning</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>AVT can be a powerful tool for language learning. Research indicates that subtitled videos improve vocabulary acquisition and listening comprehension. Educational institutions often use foreign-language content to expose students to different perspectives. Subtitled materials provide language learners with authentic, context-rich content to enhance their skills.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.ScreenOnly">Marketability THIS OUTPUT IS ONLY FOR ONLINE USERS</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.ScreenOnly">Translated and localized content resonates with audiences, creating deeper connections. Viewers are more likely to engage with content in their native language, especially when cultural nuances are carefully adapted.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.ScreenOnly">For example, a Spanish ad subtitled or dubbed into English, Mandarin, or French can reach a global audience, increasing viewership and revenue.</p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.PrintOnly">Cost-efficiency THIS OUTPUT IS FOR PRINT ONLY</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.PrintOnly">When a marketing budget doesn’t align with global ambitions, AVT offers a cost-effective solution. Some methods, like subtitling, are faster and require fewer resources compared to dubbing, which involves studio recording with voice actors.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="AVT-Conditions.PrintOnly">Subtitling is ideal for simultaneous releases in multiple regions. However, the choice of AVT method depends on various factors, including content type, audience preferences, and cultural considerations. While dubbing may be more expensive and time-consuming, it’s preferred in certain markets for its immersive experience.</p>
