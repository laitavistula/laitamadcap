            <h1>Post-editing</h1>
            <p>Post-editing is the process in which humans amend <span class="Bold">machine-generated translations</span> to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is called a <span class="Bold">post-editor</span>. The concept of post-editing is closely linked to <span class="Bold">pre-editing</span>. In machine translation, the best results are often achieved by pre-editing the source text — for example, by applying <span class="Bold">controlled language principles</span> — before post-editing the machine-generated output.</p>
            <p>Post-editing is distinct from <span class="term">editing</span>, which refers to the process of improving human-generated text (often called <span class="term">revision</span> in translation). After post-editing, the text may undergo further <span class="Bold">revision</span> to ensure the quality of language choices and to proofread for simple mistakes.</p>
            <p>Post-editing involves the correction of machine translation output to ensure that it meets a level of quality negotiated in advance between the client and the post-editor. <span class="Bold">Light post-editing</span> aims at making the output simply understandable; <span class="Bold">full post-editing</span> at making it also stylistically appropriate. With advances in machine translation, full post-editing is becoming an alternative to manual translation. Practically all <span class="Bold">computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools</span> now support post-editing of machine translated output.</p>
