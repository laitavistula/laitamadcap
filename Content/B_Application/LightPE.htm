        <h1>Light and full post-editing</h1>
        <p>For many years, there were no widely accepted, standardized guidelines for post-editing. However, in 2017, <span class="Bold"><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62970.html">ISO standard 18587:2017: Translation services — Post-editing of machine translation output — Requirements</a></span> was published, setting out the requirements for the post-editing of machine translation output. In the 1980s, studies differentiated between various degrees of post-editing, initially categorized as "conventional" and "rapid," or "full" and "rapid," in the context of the European Commission Translation Service. Today, the terms "light" and "full" post-editing are more commonly used.</p>
        <p>Light post-editing involves minimal intervention by the post-editor, aiming to ensure that the quality is "good enough" or "understandable." This type of post-editing is often used when the text is required urgently or within a short timeframe, and the client intends to use it for inbound purposes only.</p>
        <p>Full post-editing requires a greater level of intervention to achieve a quality agreed upon between the client and post-editor. The expectation is that the final output will not only be understandable but also stylistically appropriate, suitable for both inbound and outbound purposes. This type of post-editing results in text that is publishable and equivalent in quality to human translation.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, it was assumed that translating directly from the source text required less effort than post-editing machine-generated content. However, with advancements in machine translation, this assumption may no longer hold. In certain cases, particularly with language pairs and tasks that involve engines customized with domain-specific, high-quality data, some clients are already opting for post-editing rather than translation from scratch, believing that it offers comparable quality at a lower cost.</p>
        <p>The light/full classification, developed in the 1990s when machine translation was still limited to CD-ROMs, may no longer fully reflect the capabilities of modern machine translation, particularly at the light post-editing end. For some language pairs and tasks, especially when the source text has been pre-edited, raw machine output may be sufficient for gisting purposes without requiring significant human intervention.</p>
