        <h1>Pre-editing</h1>
        <p><span class="Bold">Pre-editing</span> is the process in which a human prepares a document before applying machine translation. The primary goal of pre-editing is to reduce the post-editing workload by adapting the source document to improve the quality of the machine translation output. Pre-editing can also be valuable for human translation projects, as it enhances the effectiveness of translation memory.</p>
        <p>In general, pre-editing is worth applying when there are more than three target languages. In this case, pre-editing should facilitate the process of machine translation by providing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>spell and grammar checking</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>avoiding complex or ambiguous syntactic structure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>verifying term consistency</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, it is also applicable to poorly-converted files. Linguistic pre-editing is more important than pre-editing of the format since errors can affect machine translation quality.</p>
