                <p>Localization refers to the act of translating and adapting every element of video games, software, websites, and other audiovisual materials to deliver a product that is appropriate for the country or culture it is presented to.</p>
                <p>For instance, an English saying like “When in Rome, do as the Romans do” is easy to translate into different languages. However, the denotation, which is that a person should modify their behavior depending on the situation, might be lost in translation.</p>
                <p>For this reason, the translator must be knowledgeable of the meaning behind such idioms and know a similar and acceptable translation in the target language.</p>

                <p>Subtitling is the process of placing written texts (subtitles) that shows in time with the original version of the dialogue. It usually appears at the bottom of the screen and contains the translated text, helping the viewer understand the scene.</p>
                <p>The translation needs to match the visual element that the audience is seeing. It should be accurate in meaning and context. At the same time, the subtitle should fit the given space on the screen without blocking any crucial parts of the scene.</p>
                <p>Subtitles are a great choice when learning a foreign language. The viewer hears the intonation and pronunciation of the spoken words while they read the translation in their native language. Also, subtitling helps people discover and understand foreign products like movies, commercial ads, and more.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Audiovisual translations may also be in the form of dubbing. This type of AVT lip-syncs the original text, wherein the original voice track of the source language (SL) is replaced with the voice track of the target language (TL).</p>
                <p>The dubbing process was introduced in the 1930s, along with the launch of sound movies. A French cinema played the first American sound movie back then, but the audience complained that the characters didn’t speak French. However, it was expensive to re-film or have the cast speak the foreign language with bad accents and pronunciation.</p>
                <p>In Italy and Spain, dubbing was also used during periods of dictatorship since it promoted “higher moral values” in dialogues.</p>
                <p>Dubbing is ten times more costly than subtitling because it requires hiring many professionals such as voiceover artists, directors, linguists, etc. However, it removes the often-distracting written text on the screen, making it easier for the viewer to focus on the video itself.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Audiovisual translation or AVT refers to transferring the verbal components of one language into another, given that it is found in audiovisual products or works.</p>
                <p>Some examples of audiovisual products include feature films, theatrical plays, television shows, opera, musicals, video games, and web pages, among others. These works are translated into different languages so that audiences can simultaneously watch and listen to the material in their mother language.</p>
                <p>AVT aims to support internationalization, allowing content to be consumed by people across multiple countries. As the term suggests, AVT is designed to be heard and seen (audio and visual)</p>
