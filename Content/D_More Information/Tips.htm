        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p>If you want to feel like a subtitler:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>Download a subtitle editor - it can be <a href="https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/releases">Subtitle Edit</a> or any other software of your choice: check out <MadCap:xref href="Useful-Links.htm">Useful Links</MadCap:xref> for some suggestions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Upload a film fragment of your choice, in its original version. Before uploading, make sure you don't infringe anyone's copyright!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Propose your own translation. Remember about the guidelines above - your version should be short, clear, legible, and of course understandable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>More of a fansubber? Try your hand at translating shows or anime! Google fansubbing groups active in your country and ask them to allow you to work with them.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are some simple tasks to try out!</p>
        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <p>This is a warm-up before translating, also called <span class="Bold">"shadowing"</span>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a film or a programme you like, in your native language or a foreign one you know well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Do not translate anything, simply repeat what you hear.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you want to make it more challenging, bring a piece of paper and write the letters of the alphabet (first - in order, then - backwards) while speaking.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Task 2</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a film where the characters speak your native language (or any language you are more or less familiar with) and set up subtitles in the same language.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Analyse the difference between what you hear and what you read. You may propose a better version if you see any major differences.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Task 3</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Choose a film in a foreign language you know fairly well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Translate while watching - utter the translated version aloud.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To make the task easier, you may watch the film twice, for the first time to understand the film better, write down particularly tricky phrases etc. and for the second time to produce your translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you want to test yourself first, you may start with something easy, e.g. news programmes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
