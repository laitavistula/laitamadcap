        <h1>Subtitling</h1>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles">Subtitling</a>  is one of the most extensively studied modes of multimedia translation. It involves displaying written text on a screen to convey "a target language version of the source speech." The most commonly used subtype is interlinguistic subtitling, which appears as open captions. In multilingual regions, bilingual subtitles are employed to display translations in two different languages simultaneously.</p>
        <h2>Live subtitling</h2>
        <p>Also known as "real-time subtitling," this mode differs from regular subtitling as it is not pre-recorded but generated on the spot. Live subtitling is primarily used for live broadcasts to aid viewers who are hard of hearing. A "respeaker" listens to the original dialogue of a live event and "respeaks" it into speech recognition software. The respeaker’s input includes punctuation marks and features tailored for the target audience. This process creates subtitles with minimal delay, ensuring accessibility during live events.</p>
        <h2>The role of speed in subtitle processing</h2>
        <p>While subtitles in one’s native (L1) or second language (L2) can enhance learning, they can also strain cognitive resources. Watching subtitled videos requires rapid attention shifts between text and visuals, which can be challenging if subtitle speed is too high. To improve learning outcomes, subtitles need to be easy to process, with sufficient time for reading. However, subtitle speed has been steadily increasing in the last decades, and no study to date has explored how speed affects cognate processing (and potentially learning).    Subtitle speed is typically measured in <span class="Bold">characters per second (cps)</span>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Faster subtitles (e.g., 20 cps) are more demanding, leading to shallow processing, shorter fixation durations, fewer fixations, and less re-reading.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Currently, typical speeds range between 12 and 20 cps, with streaming services such as Netflix using up to 20 cps for English subtitles in the US market (Netflix, 2021).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Eye-Tracking Research Insights</h2>
        <p>Previous eye-tracking research on subtitle reading has consistently demonstrated that subtitles are great gaze attractors.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Viewers tend to look at subtitles when they are displayed and this phenomenon holds true regardless of viewers’ prior experience with subtitling or the type of subtitles</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Additionally, access to the film’s soundtrack—whether through sound presence or familiarity with the language—affects how viewers engage with subtitled content. Familiarity with the language of the soundtrack can reduce cognitive strain and enhance understanding.</p>
