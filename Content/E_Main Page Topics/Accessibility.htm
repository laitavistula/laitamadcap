        </ul>
        <p>SDH helps individuals who have difficulty hearing dialogue by allowing them to "see" the sound. While similar to regular subtitling, SDH provides additional information to convey non-verbal elements such as sound effects, music, and speaker identification. Originally, these subtitles were mainly available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts. However, the growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has led to minimum quota requirements for broadcasters and subtitling companies to provide SDH.</p>

        <p>AD is meant for those who are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>blind,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>visually-impaired </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>partially-sighted </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example. The AD track is carefully inserted during silent parts of the content, ensuring it does not interfere with the original dialogue. The "audio describer" strikes a balance between providing necessary plot details and avoiding excessive information. While AD is typically pre-recorded, it can also be delivered live in settings such as theaters. This mode of multimedia translation plays a vital role in ensuring audiovisual products are accessible to the visually impaired.</p>
